IS 477 final project. Collaborating with Stefan Chu.

# Overview
The Turkish Music Emotion dataset created by Mehmet Bilal Er from Harran University looks to study music emotion recognition by using sentiment analyis tools to classify music emotions into four different classes: happy, sad, angry, and relax. The dataset uses a total of 400 music pieces from different genres of Turkish music, both verbal and nonverbal. Each class has an equal number of samples, 100 music pieces. The Turkish Music Emotion dataset can be obtained on the UCI Machine Learning Repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/862/turkish+music+emotion. It was donated on 14 August 2023

# Contributions
Stefan Chu: Worked on prepare_data.py and profile.py. Created the Snakefile for workflow to run all python files. Created gitignore and requirements.txt files. Ashwin Krishnan: worked on the prepare_data.py, requirements.txt file, and analysis.py.

# Analysis
We created a graph that visualizes the relationship between the "_HarmonicChangeDetectionFunction_PeriodEntropy" (harmonics in audio signals) and "Class" variables. Essentially, it shows which values of harmonic detection lead to music being classified in the four different emotions of sounding "happy," "sad," "angry," and "relax(ed)."
